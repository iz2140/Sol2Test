# Sol2Test

This is a demonstration project for the Sol library. See the "UsingSol" branch to compare it with master.

To build the Demo Project, you must have Xcode installed with SFML, Lua, and set the linker flags, build settings, architecture, etc as appropriate.

1. Using SFML with XCode: http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.3/start-osx.php
2. Install Lua locally: http://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/readme.html
3. Place the lua directory containing the  install folder that was produced from this step 2 into the root directory of the Xcode project. 
4. Install Sol2 and place sol.hpp and Sol source files into the same directory that main.cpp will run in.
